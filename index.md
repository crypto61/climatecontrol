# SSA Team 3 Project Archive

## Design Document Links below represent archival repository of full system specification, design notes, early design diagrams, and speradsheets. 
All of these collectively represent the underlying design considerations, critical examinations of design alternatives or options not included,
and probability data which guided selection of vulnerabilities to be assigned countermeasures.

As the assignment limit of 600 words does not permit full expression of the processes followed, collaborative critical reviews and lessons learned,
this archive is intended to be useful to the tutor or other graders as well as for futher reference by the design team in continuing onward in the 
full design, code implementation and testing during units 4-6.
